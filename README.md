## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project?

I have continued to work on building web apps using React but this was my first time working independently on using Typescript as well as using a different database, Appwrite, to store information.

## Why did you want to build this project?

I wanted to build this because of the need for productivity amongst team members, especially in my current work setting. There are plenty of task management apps that do this as well but I also wanted to create one for my personal and team use. I also wanted to build upon my React skills and get better at authentication, especially adding a signup page, using usecontext better, and bringing a different database into my project.

## What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

The biggest challenge for me was using Typescript. I did not understand all of the ways Typescript could be used so I would use AI to help me understand how to write it out. I used Appwrite to connect my application to a back-end API. I used Youtube videos, AI, and courses from the past to me understand the code. Another challenge was using shadcn and understanding the function given by shadcn extensions like the Kanban board that would break some of the code I was using with native shadcn components.
